## Variability
The Sum of Squares is a good measure for variance in a vector, since it is given by how each random variable differes from the mean and square it so all values are positive;
Sum of squares is given by $SS = \sum(x_{1} - \overline{x})^2$ adding all variability from each value. Therefore, we can assess the mean variability (variance) dividing by 
N - 1
$s^2 = \sum \frac{(x_{1} - \overline{x})^2}{N - 1}$

However, variance is given in $unit^2$ which may difficult its interpretation
